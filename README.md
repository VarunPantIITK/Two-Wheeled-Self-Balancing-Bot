# Two-Wheeled-Self-Balancing-Bot
Semester Project 2021

Hello I am Varun Pant, 1st year UG in dept. of Aerospace Er., IIT Kanpur. This is my first project as student of IIT-Kanpur. I have taken this project in my freshman year under Robotics Club of SnT Council, IIT Kanpur.

## Objectives
- The main objective of this robot is to balance the whole body on two wheels automatically by designing the best possible structure for the body.
- To demonstrate the method and techniques involved in balancing an unstable robotic platform on two wheels.
- To design and implement a complete discrete digital control system with the state space model that will provide robotic stability.
- Design controllers like PID and LQR for two-wheeled robot and their implementation in MATLAB.
- There has been varieties of technique to increase the robotic stability on dynamic environments .One such popular technique used for mobile robots is an inverted pendulum based model. We aim to learn it
